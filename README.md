# The Enduring Influence of Anime on Cinema

### Live link: mes-film-guide.vercel.app

A beautifully designed, single-page web experience exploring how groundbreaking anime films shaped Hollywood's biggest movies. This project pairs three iconic anime masterpieces with the live-action films they directly influenced, creating an educational journey through the intersection of Japanese animation and Western cinema.

## 🎯 Purpose

This web app serves as an interactive film guide that:

- **Showcases** the creative lineage between Japanese animation and Western cinema
- **Celebrates** the work of visionary directors like Satoshi Kon and Mamoru Oshii
- **Provides** a curated viewing experience with context, commentary, and further reading

The site explores three "courses" that question the nature of reality, identity, and what it means to be human, culminating in a poignant dessert course that reflects on art and memory.

## 📚 Film Pairings
