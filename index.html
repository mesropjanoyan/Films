        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section class="intro">
            <p>Welcome! This is a collection of some of the most groundbreaking and mind-bending anime ever made—films that also happen to be some of my all-time favorites. Think of this as an exploration of how creative Japanese animation didn't just <em>inspire</em> but actively <em>shaped</em> many of the live-action movies we know and love.</p>
            
            <p>Here you'll find three double features. Each one pairs a classic, must-see anime with the famous live-action film that it directly influenced.</p>
            
            <p>These films all share a common theme: they question the nature of reality, identity, and what it means to be human. Expect stunning animation, deep questions, and psychological thrills that will stay with you long after the credits roll.</p>
            
            <p>Prepare yourself for a film marathon that is as smart as it is exciting. You're about to see where these incredible ideas first came to life in animation, and <em>then</em> how they were brought to the big screen.</p>

                <h2>First Course: The System</h2>
                <p class="course-films"><em>Ghost in the Shell</em> (1995) & <em>The Matrix</em> (1999)</p>
            </div>

            <p class="course-intro">Before there was "the Matrix," there was the "Ghost." This double feature lays the groundwork, boldly asking us to question the fabric of our existence.</p>

            <p class="note"><em>(A quick note: The version you are viewing is <strong>Ghost in the Shell 2.0</strong> (2008), which is the original 1995 film remastered by the director with some updated visuals. It is not a sequel.)</em></p>

            <div class="disclaimer">
                <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> features sequences of animated violence and nudity.

                    <h3>Ghost in the Shell (1995)</h3>
                    <p>Mamoru Oshii's <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> is a cyberpunk classic. Set in a future where minds can be "hacked" and bodies are fully replaceable, it follows Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg agent, as she hunts a mysterious hacker. But the real chase is about her own identity, as the film digs into what it means to be human when your "self" or "ghost" can be copied or exist outside a physical body. Its blend of breathtaking animation, deep thinking, and sleek, tactical action set a new global standard.</p>

                    <h3>The Matrix (1999)</h3>
                    <p>The Wachowskis were so profoundly influenced that they reportedly pitched <em>The Matrix</em> to producers by showing them <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> and saying, "We want to do that, but in live-action." You'll see its DNA everywhere: from the green "digital rain" code to the direct plug-in ports in the back of the neck.</p>

                <p class="course-films"><em>Perfect Blue</em> (1997) & <em>Black Swan</em> (2010)</p>
            </div>

            <p class="course-intro">This double feature gets personal. It descends into the chilling depths of psychological horror, where the boundaries between identity, ambition, and delusion shatter. It explores the terrifying unreliability of one's own mind.</p>

            <div class="disclaimer warning">
                <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Both films contain intense psychological horror, violence, and scenes depicting sexual violence. Viewer discretion is strongly advised.

                    <h3>Perfect Blue (1997)</h3>
                    <p>Satoshi Kon's directorial debut, <em>Perfect Blue</em>, is a masterclass in suspense. It follows Mima, a pop idol who retires to become an actress. As she takes on a dark, risky role, her life begins to unravel. She's stalked by an obsessive fan, her "innocent" past self seems to haunt her, and the lines between her real life and the role she's playing blur into a paranoid nightmare. Kon's clever, disorienting editing makes you question every single frame, forcing you to feel Mima's fracturing mind alongside her.</p>

                    <h3>Black Swan (2010)</h3>
                    <p>The connection to Aronofsky's work is fascinating. He actually purchased the US remake rights to <em>Perfect Blue</em> years earlier, which allowed him to recreate one of its most famous scenes shot-for-shot in his 2000 film <em>Requiem for a Dream</em> (a clear homage!). While Aronofsky has publicly denied <em>Black Swan</em> was a direct influence, the parallels are uncanny—a female performer's descent into madness, a pursuing doppelgänger, the loss of self in a role. Critics and audiences consider it a clear "spiritual successor," bringing Kon's core ideas to visceral, Oscar-winning life.</p>

                <p class="course-films"><em>Paprika</em> (2006) & <em>Inception</em> (2010)</p>
            </div>

            <p class="course-intro">This final pairing takes the big-picture questions of <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> and the intense psychological stress of <em>Perfect Blue</em> and explodes them onto the screen. Here, the internal world of dreams doesn't just threaten the self—it threatens to collapse reality itself.</p>

                    <h3>Paprika (2006)</h3>
                    <p>Satoshi Kon's final feature, <em>Paprika</em>, is a dazzling, kaleidoscopic trip into the subconscious. It centers on a new device called the "DC Mini," which allows therapists to enter patients' dreams. When prototypes are stolen, the boundaries between the dream world and the waking world begin to tear, unleashing a surreal, chaotic parade of collective subconscious thought upon the city. <em>Paprika</em> is an explosion of pure imagination, a vibrant, exhilarating, and sometimes terrifying ride.</p>

                    <h3>Inception (2010)</h3>
                    <p>Just a few years later, Christopher Nolan's <em>Inception</em> captivated audiences with its elaborate dreamscapes. While Nolan has never publicly credited <em>Paprika</em> as an influence, critics and film fans immediately noted the stunning similarities. You'll see them everywhere: a team using technology to enter and manipulate dreams, the physics of those dreams bending to the subconscious, the disorientation when dream layers collapse, and even specific visual cues (like the famous hallway-bending scene). <em>Inception</em> masterfully translated <em>Paprika's</em> core ideas into a sleek, mind-bending blockbuster.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="course-intro">After that intense marathon, it's time for the dessert course. This film brings our entire screening full circle, taking the same reality-bending techniques and applying them not to sci-fi or horror, but to a truly beautiful and heartfelt reflection on a life lived through art.

                    <h3>The Millennium Actress (2001)</h3>
                    <p>Another masterpiece from Satoshi Kon, <em>The Millennium Actress</em>, is a breathtaking and unique film. It follows a documentary crew interviewing Chiyoko Fujiwara, a legendary actress who vanished from public view decades ago. As she recounts her life story, her real memories seamlessly blend with the countless movie roles she played, sending the filmmakers (and us) on a fantastical chase through Japanese history as seen through her films.</p>
                    <p>Visually stunning, emotionally rich, and cleverly constructed, <em>The Millennium Actress</em> is a moving conclusion to our exploration—a beautiful reminder that while reality may be fluid, the power of our memories, our art, and our passions is eternal.</p>
